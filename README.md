## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Bootstrap CSS
- Mobile first workflow
- Express - NodeJS Framework

### What I learned

From the project i learnt how to use express js as a framework i also learnt what cookies and sessions are and how they help in the application.

<!-- To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
export default async function fetchSearch({ queryKey }) {
    const { animal, location, breed } = queryKey[1];
    const res = await fetch(`http://pets-v2.dev-apis.com/pets?animal=${animal}&location=${location}&breed=${breed}`);
    if (!res.ok) { throw new Error(`pet search not okay: ${animal}, ${location}, ${breed}`); }
    return res.json();
}
``` -->


### Continued development

I will continue learning on how to make use of the express framework to bring a lot of projects to life and thus it has been a really amazing time learning all the concepts down to even learning how to test using jest.I will continue using the above guides even as I build more web applications that can serve users with a seamless experience while also mainting the best developer practices.
